        <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is a collaborative style of coding meant to facilitate cleaner code and prevent errors. It
        generally consists of one person driving (writing the code) and the other navigating (giving direction to the
        person who is driving). There is some back and forth between the two, but generally the navigator
        is leading the conversation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='right column'>
        <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming encourages development of strong communication skills
          and collaborative problem solving. Because pairs rarely have the same skill level or experience, pairing provides both programmers with an excellent
          learning opportunity as either a teacher or a student. Another benefit of pairing is that there are multiple sets of eyes to catch errors and debug code.

        <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
        <p class="left column">The driver is the person typing the actual code. They contribute to the direction of the program
          that is being coded, but not as directly as the navigator.
        </p>
        <p class="right column">The navigator tends to lead the decision making as to how a program will be coded, and coordinates
          with the driver to ensure the driver knows how to code what they have agreed upon.
        </p>

        <h3>Pairing for the First Time</h3>
        <p>Pairing for the first time was exciting.
          I wasn't just meeting a stranger; I was getting to meet one of the people in my cohort!
          Working with someone whose desires aligned with mine reduced my anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>The session started slow, with the expected small talk and discussion of what we would be doing.
          Once we began working on our challenge the pace increased, in a good way.
          Our exchange of ideas and eventual swap of driver and navigator roles felt natural.
