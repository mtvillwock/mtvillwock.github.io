    <p>Lisa stared at herself in the mirror. Perfect, she thought. Not me, necessarily, but this. Today. She felt a tremble of excitement run up her spine, beneath the white dress that Tara had laced up for her. There was a knock at the door. "Come in."</p>

<p>Tyson strolled into the room, his hands in his black trouser pockets. "Hey."</p>

<p>"Hi."</p>

<p>His hands played across the buttons of his purple vest. "Did you ever imagine it would end like this?" A smile crept across his face.</p>

<p>"No." Lisa grinned back at him. "But I'm glad it did." She pulled a white veil over her head. "Come on, let's go have a wedding."</p>

<p>They exited the dressing room, arm in arm. As they reached the staging area, Tyson unhooked his arm from Lisa's, intending to let her slip away to join her bridesmaids. Instead he grabbed her wrist, pulling her back toward him and taking her hands in his. "Lisa."</p>

<p>"Tyson, what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing. Just..." He looked at the floor, the ceiling, and both walls. Finally, he looked her in the eyes. "Look, Lisa. I just want you know that I think you are making the right choice. And that I support your decision."</p>

<p>Lisa frowned. "Tyson, please don't make a scene. Not here, not now. I thought we went over this. More than once, if I recall."</p>

<p>Tyson nodded. "No, no, you don't understand. This isn't some last-ditch effort. I'm one hundred percent sincere. I think that you are making the right decision by marrying Mark. I know that you don't need my permission or anything stupid like that." He ran his hand through his hair. "I just wanted you to know that I mean it. That I won't show up some night five years from now, in the pouring rain, with a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of Cabernet and your favorite movie, trying to win you back from him. We had our run. It was good. But it wasn't supposed to last." He let go of her hands. "It just took me longer to realize that. And to accept it."</p>

<p>Lisa stood still, staring at Tyson's face, watching his jaw muscles move, his eyes darting around. "Thank you." She wrapped her arms around his neck. They stood like that for a while, her hugging him and him unsure what to do. After a moment her body began to heave in minuscule intervals.</p>

<p>"Lisa," said Tyson. "Lisa, are you crying?"</p>

<p>She pulled back from him, carefully dabbing at the corners of her eyes with her wrist. "No, no. I'm fine. I'm okay." She looked up at him. "I didn't ruin my makeup, did I?"</p>

<p>Tyson rolled his eyes. "You know you're beautiful without it."</p>

<p>She punched him playfully. "Save your lines for someone single, you goof."</p>

<p>He smiled. "As you wish."</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Tyson stood behind Mark's brother and Derek, their mutual friend since middle school. The music played, and Lisa and Mark began their walk down the aisle.</p>

<p>He smiled, and for once it was a real smile, not a pained, fake-happy, half-grimace that showed up at every photo shoot he had ever been in. They made it. They made it through different colleges and two years of long-distance and through me. They deserve this.</p>

<p>Mark and Lisa separated as they made their way up to the pulpit. They rejoined one another in front of the pastor, and their smiles beamed at each other like twin spotlights. The ceremony commenced.</p>

<p>Tyson's smile faded to a grin. In a way, everything that had happened had needed to happen. Without those events – the debacle in Chicago, the Boston road trip, and even Derek's intervention all those years ago in their apartment senior year in Madison – none of them would be standing here today. A single tear rolled down Tyson's face. He made no move to wipe it away; it was on the side of his face away from the audience.</p>

<p>Mark and Lisa finished their vows and the pastor pronounced them man and wife. As Mark leaned in to Lisa, cradling her as he bequeathed his first married kiss on his bride, Tyson couldn't help thinking of the Princess Bride. <em>"Since the invention of the kiss, there have only been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind."</em> He chuckled under his breath. Okay, maybe it wasn't that good of a kiss. But from where it stood, it was his favorite that he had ever seen, given, or received.</p>

<p>The kiss ended. Mark and Lisa made their way down the aisle, followed by the groomsmen and bridesmaids. Tyson hooked arms with Jennifer, and strode tall out of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, Tyson sat three seats down from Mark at the dinner reception. He looked out over the crowd of friends and family. How far we've come. And we're not done yet. Derek stood up to give his best man speech, and Tyson smiled.</p>

<p>"Attention, attention, everyone." Derek clinked his fork on his champagne flute and stood up. "Hey everybody, I'm Derek, the best man. I think you all know me." Light laughter filled the room. "Good." He turned to Tyson and winked. "Let me tell you the story of Mark and Lisa. You see, when they first met..."</p>

<p>Tyson leaned back in his chair. For once, he didn't try to rewrite the future.</p>
