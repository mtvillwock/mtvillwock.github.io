              <h3>Conflict and the Wheel of Shame</h3>

              <p><blockquote><em>"Shame is supposed to
              be a protective response to keep us connected to the group rather than wondering off dangerously by ourselves.
              It has been given to us to help us survive and to eliminate it would not be safe."</em></blockquote></p>
              <p>In a paper from the Southdown Institute, Harold Grossman discusses the "<a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">compass of shame</a>." The compass has 4 directions, each of which corresponds to a person's response to shame. The four variations are Withdrawal, Avoidance, Attack Others, and Attack Self. Take a few minutes and read the article in the link above, then come back here.</p>
              <p>Back? Cool. So what about conflict? Everyone experiences conflict at some point in their life, and as I'm sure you've been told, it is their reaction to the conflict – not the conflict itself – that shapes their life. So what about me? When have I faced conflict, and how did I handle it?</p>
              <p>That's a good question.</p>

              <h3>You Can Run, But You Can't Hide (From Yourself)</h3>

              <p>College was the end of my first serious long-term relationship. Common enough occurrence, I suppose. To make a long story short, it became apparent over time that my girlfriend and I were in different places in our lives. She wanted to live together. I wasn't ready for that. I withdrew from her. I gave wishy-washy answers. I was ashamed of myself.</p>
              <p>Additional back-story that is somewhat relevant: my parents had a bitter divorce when I was 10 and because of this I <em>really</em>, <b>really</b>, <em><b>really</b></em> don't like conflict. I try to make other people happy and comfortable. Sometimes this is a horrible thing to do.</p>
              <p>The point that I'm slowly meandering towards is that by withdrawing from a situation that was going to be a conflict, I ended up creating a bigger fallout down the road. I was so focused on avoiding conflict that I didn't realize that not addressing the central issue as soon as it came up would just generate a bigger problem down the road.</p>
              <p><img src="http://quotes.lifehack.org/media/quotes/quote-Len-Goodman-you-have-to-speak-your-mind-but-181097_1.png"></p>
              <p>If I could go back, I would have ended things then and there. It's easy to say that, almost three years removed and from the safety of a keyboard, but that result would have saved us both several months of unhappy togetherness.</p>
              <p>I learned that saying what you feel, even if it conflicts with someone else's desires, is better than going along with something you disagree with just to avoid conflict.</p>
