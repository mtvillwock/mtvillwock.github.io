         <h2>Shuffle Up and Deal: A Sample Ruby Class</h2>
         <p id="date">Nov. 9th, 2014</hp>

        <div id="content">
          <h3>What are Classes?</h3>
            <p>Everything in Ruby is an object. However, objects are sorted
              into many different categories called Classes, all of which
              have different attributes. The most common classes are things
              like Integers and Floats (rounded vs decimal numbers), Strings
              (letters and words), and data structures like <a href="http://mtvillwock.github.io/blog/t3-arrays-hashes.html">Hashes and Arrays</a>.</p>
            <p>But you aren't limited to just those ubiquitous classes. You can make your
            own classes in Ruby, and give them methods. Methods are like the "verbs" to
            Classes "nouns" in Ruby. Why would you want to make your own class?</p>
            <p>First off, why wouldn't you? Making things is fun! But in all seriousness,
              making classes is a helpful way to model real-world objects (there's that word again), which makes it easier to understand how things work (and to explain it to the computer).</p>
            <p>Another useful aspect of making classes is that doing so allows you do divide large,
              unwieldy methods into smaller, bite-sized methods. This is important for a few reasons, like readability and debugging, but also because it just makes sense sometimes.</p>
            <p>For example, you could have a program that simulated someone playing football. It might look like this:</p>
            <p>
            <pre><code>
            def play_football
              # run the ball
              # throw the ball
              # catch the ball
              # block that kick
              # celebrate after scoring
            end
            </code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>That's a lot of stuff crammed into one method, right?</p>
            <p>But if you break up the methods more discretely using a class, it looks like this:</p>
            <p>
              <pre><code>
              class FootballPlayer

                def tackle
                  # wrap up offensive player's legs
                  # drag offensive player to ground
                end

                def pass
                  # throw ball to @variable_representing_receiver
                end

                def celebrate
                  # jump in the stands with the fans
                end

              end
              </code></pre>
            </p>

            <p>I realize that is just some gibberish code, but I hope it illustrates the concept of using a class in order to contain many small methods instead of cramming a ton of actions into one large method.</p>

          <h3>The Real-World</h3>
            <p>I said earlier that Classes are useful for modeling real-world objects. Usually to do this effectively, one needs to use data structures (although not always). Here's an example:</p>
            <p>
              <pre><code>
class DeckOfCards
  def initialize
    @deck = {
      :spade_ace => "Ace of Spades",
      :spade_king => "King of Spades",
      :spade_queen => "Queen of Spades",
      :spade_jack => "Jack of Spades",
      :spade_10 => "Ten of Spades",
      :spade_9 => "Nine of Spades",
      :spade_8 => "Eight of Spades",
      :spade_7 => "Seven of Spades",
      :spade_6 => "Six of Spades",
      :spade_5 => "Five of Spades",
      :spade_4 => "Four of Spades",
      :spade_3 => "Three of Spades",
      :spade_2 => "Two of Spades",
      :heart_ace => "Ace of Hearts",
      :heart_king => "King of Hearts",
      :heart_queen => "Queen of Hearts",
      :heart_jack => "Jack of Hearts",
      :heart_10 => "Ten of Hearts",
      :heart_9 => "Nine of Hearts",
      :heart_8 => "Eight of Hearts",
      :heart_7 => "Seven of Hearts",
      :heart_6 => "Six of Hearts",
      :heart_5 => "Five of Hearts",
      :heart_4 => "Four of Hearts",
      :heart_3 => "Three of Hearts",
      :heart_2 => "Two of Hearts",
      :club_ace => "Ace of Clubs",
      :club_king => "King of Clubs",
      :club_queen => "Queen of Clubs",
      :club_jack => "Jack of Clubs",
      :club_10 => "Ten of Clubs",
      :club_9 => "Nine of Clubs",
      :club_8 => "Eight of Clubs",
      :club_7 => "Seven of Clubs",
      :club_6 => "Six of Clubs",
      :club_5 => "Five of Clubs",
      :club_4 => "Four of Clubs",
      :club_3 => "Three of Clubs",
      :club_2 => "Two of Clubs",
      :diamond_ace => "Ace of Diamonds",
      :diamond_king => "King of Diamonds",
      :diamond_queen => "Queen of Diamonds",
      :diamond_jack => "Jack of Diamonds",
      :diamond_10 => "Ten of Diamonds",
      :diamond_9 => "Nine of Diamonds",
      :diamond_8 => "Eight of Diamonds",
      :diamond_7 => "Seven of Diamonds",
      :diamond_6 => "Six of Diamonds",
      :diamond_5 => "Five of Diamonds",
      :diamond_4 => "Four of Diamonds",
      :diamond_3 => "Three of Diamonds",
      :diamond_2 => "Two of Diamonds",
    }
  end

  def reveal
    p "Here's the deck."
    puts @deck.values
  end

  def shuffle
    p "Let's shuffle 'em up."
    @shuffled_deck = @deck.values.shuffle!
    puts @shuffled_deck
    p "There we go. Nice and random."
  end


  def random_card
    @random_card = @shuffled_deck.shuffle![0]
    p "Here's a random card. It's the #{@random_card}."
  end

end

p deck = DeckOfCards.new</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>Pretty simple, just a deck of cards. It does what you would expect a deck of cards to do (which is nothing). But like a deck of cards you can shuffle it, and you can pick a random card. You can't play a game with it yet (sorry, cardsharks!), but as a class it does a few things. Let's look at each of those.</p>
          <h3>Anatomy of A Class</h3>
            <p>The first thing you'll see in a class is the Class name. And yes, it does need to be CamelCase capitalized like that.</p>
            <pre><code>class DeckOfCards</code></pre>
            <p>The next part is the initialize method. The initialize method dictates what happens when an instance of new class is created. Creating a class is done like this:</p>
            <p><pre><code>deck = DeckOfCards.new</code></pre></p>
            <p>That word – instance – is important. In regards to a class it means a new copy. In this case, every new instance of DeckOfCards is initialized with a Hash containing key/value pairs of all 52 cards. It looks like this:</p>
            <p><pre><code>def initialize
    @deck = {
      :spade_ace => "Ace of Spades",
      :spade_king => "King of Spades",
      :spade_queen => "Queen of Spades",
      :spade_jack => "Jack of Spades",
      :spade_10 => "Ten of Spades",
      :spade_9 => "Nine of Spades",
      :spade_8 => "Eight of Spades",
      :spade_7 => "Seven of Spades",
      :spade_6 => "Six of Spades",
      :spade_5 => "Five of Spades",
      :spade_4 => "Four of Spades",
      :spade_3 => "Three of Spades",
      :spade_2 => "Two of Spades",
      :heart_ace => "Ace of Hearts",
      :heart_king => "King of Hearts",
      :heart_queen => "Queen of Hearts",
      :heart_jack => "Jack of Hearts",
      :heart_10 => "Ten of Hearts",
      :heart_9 => "Nine of Hearts",
      :heart_8 => "Eight of Hearts",
      :heart_7 => "Seven of Hearts",
      :heart_6 => "Six of Hearts",
      :heart_5 => "Five of Hearts",
      :heart_4 => "Four of Hearts",
      :heart_3 => "Three of Hearts",
      :heart_2 => "Two of Hearts",
      :club_ace => "Ace of Clubs",
      :club_king => "King of Clubs",
      :club_queen => "Queen of Clubs",
      :club_jack => "Jack of Clubs",
      :club_10 => "Ten of Clubs",
      :club_9 => "Nine of Clubs",
      :club_8 => "Eight of Clubs",
      :club_7 => "Seven of Clubs",
      :club_6 => "Six of Clubs",
      :club_5 => "Five of Clubs",
      :club_4 => "Four of Clubs",
      :club_3 => "Three of Clubs",
      :club_2 => "Two of Clubs",
      :diamond_ace => "Ace of Diamonds",
      :diamond_king => "King of Diamonds",
      :diamond_queen => "Queen of Diamonds",
      :diamond_jack => "Jack of Diamonds",
      :diamond_10 => "Ten of Diamonds",
      :diamond_9 => "Nine of Diamonds",
      :diamond_8 => "Eight of Diamonds",
      :diamond_7 => "Seven of Diamonds",
      :diamond_6 => "Six of Diamonds",
      :diamond_5 => "Five of Diamonds",
      :diamond_4 => "Four of Diamonds",
      :diamond_3 => "Three of Diamonds",
      :diamond_2 => "Two of Diamonds",
    }
  end</code></pre></p>

            <p>Instance variables (like @deck) are different than normal variables. Marked by an @ symbol, instance methods act as attributes that exist across methods within a class. In this case, the instance variable @deck will be accessible by other methods in the DeckOfCards class.</p>
            <p>Okay, so we have a (virtual) deck of cards. What can we do with it? Let's look at some more methods.</p>
            <p><pre><code>
            def reveal
              p "Here's the deck."
              puts @deck.values
            end
            </code></pre></p>
            <p>This method tells the user "Here's the deck" and then prints the values of all of the key/value pairs in the @deck Hash to the console. Note the use of the instance variable @deck. We didn't need to define what @deck was in this method because instance variables can be used in other methods.</p>
            <p><pre><code>
            def shuffle
              p "Let's shuffle 'em up."
              @shuffled_deck = @deck.values.shuffle!
              puts @shuffled_deck
            end
            </code></pre></p>
            <p>This does method tells the user "Let's shuffle 'em up.". It then creates an instance variable called @shuffled_deck which is an Array made up of shuffled values from key/value pairings in the @deck Hash, which it then prints. You can see how using instance variables instead of redefining local variables in each method can be helpful for transferring information and reducing redundancy.</p>
            <p><pre><code>
            def random_card
              @random_card = @shuffled_deck.shuffle![0]
              p "Here's a random card. It's the #{@random_card}."
            end
            </code></pre></p>
            <p>This method creates an instance variable called @random_card, which it determines by taking the 0th index (1st card) of the shuffled @shuffled_deck Array (which, if you'll recall, is made up of values from the key/value pairs that were in the @deck Hash).</p>
          <h3>Classes, For Instance</h3>
            <p>So that was a lot of information and terminology, perhaps not explained in the easiest way. Let's recap a few of the highlights:
              <ul>
                <li>Classes are useful for modeling real-world object</li>
                <li>You can make your own Classes</li>
                <li>Classes allow you to break up long methods into several methods and keep them all in one place</li>
                <li>Instance variables are cool because they can be used in different methods within a class instead of having to be redefined like local variables</li>
                <li>New instances of a class are initialized with attributes determined by the initialize method</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I mention inheritance or attribute reader/writer methods, but trust me, those are awesome too. I'll just say a little here. Inheritance basically lets you have a class inherit the traits of a class above it. This works similarly to genetics and zoological classification (humans love categorizing things, don't we?). Attribute reader and writer methods are a way of saving time/code. Simply put, this:
            </p>
            <p><pre><code>
              def age
                @age = age
              end

              def change_age(new_age)
                @age = new_age
              end
            </code></pre></p>
            <p>is equivalent to this:</p>
            <p><pre><code>
              attr_reader :age
              attr_writer :age
            </code></pre></p>
            <p>That's all I've got for you this week. Until next time, you stay classy, faithful reader!</p>
