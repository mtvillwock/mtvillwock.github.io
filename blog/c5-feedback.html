          <h3>Two to Tango</h3>
            <p>The importance of pair programming is impressed on boots early in the DBC experience. We have a benchmark amount of pairing sessions we are supposed to complete during every unit, providing feedback for our partner afterward. This is one of my favorite parts of Phase 0 so far.</p>
            <p>Pairing is awesome for solving challenges because you have someone there with you. There is a term in programming called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck debugging</a> which refers to talking through your code to a rubber duck in order to discover what the difference between what you want your code to do and what it actually is doing. Pair programming takes that to another level by adding a live person that you can discuss strategy with, ask for clarification on how different methods work, and generally exchange thoughts with about your code.</p>
            <p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pair_programming_1.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Pair_programming_1.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Pair_programming_1.jpg" alt="Pair programming 1.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a><br>"<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pair_programming_1.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Pair_programming_1.jpg">Pair programming 1</a>" by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.flickr.com/people/78453620@N00">Lisamarie Babik</a> - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/78453620@N00/552208117/">Ted &amp; Ian</a>

            <p>Cheesy as it sounds, this "buddy system" is a spectacular tool for learning, even if the people pairing have different experience levels. If you're the more experienced programmer, you have the opportunity to refine your own understanding of processes by explaining it to someone who is unfamiliar with them. If you are less experienced, then you get to learn from someone who knows more than you. Hopefully someone with an attitude like <a href="http://xkcd.com/1053/">this</a>!</p>
            <p>Pair programming isn't all sunshine and high-fives. Sometimes neither of you knows how to solve the problem you're working on. Sometimes your pair won't say what they are thinking, or they try driving from the backseat. Maybe you're having a stressful day/week and are struggling to muster the patience to explain concepts to your partner. These difficulties are certainly issues that arise. But each time they do, that's a good thing.</p>
            <p>Wait, what?</p>
            <p>That's right – even the "bad" pairing sessions can be great. Situations where you struggle to communicate or just generally have difficulty solving a challenge give you a better idea of what you should focus on improving. Maybe you need to read up on a certain concept so that you can articulate it to your pair instead of just letting them solve it for you. Maybe you need to practice explaining your thought process (true story: nobody will think you are brilliant if you can't explain how/why you are doing what you're doing).</p>

            <p>Pairing is all about communication, which is a central tenant of just about anything productive in society. It forces you to stretch yourself by adapting to another person. And that's a good thing.</p>
          <h3>The Feedback Loop</h3>
            <p>One of the most frustrating parts of college education for me was how long I had to wait to see how I performed on a task. You'd write a paper, turn it in, and not hear back about it for weeks at a time. By the time you got feedback on it, you were already working on a different project and could hardly recall why you wrote the essay the way you did. Dev Bootcamp is different. You get feedback after every pairing session and other students can comment on your repositories with suggestions of how to improve your code.</p>

            <p><blockquote><em>Pair programming is a fast way to get feedback, while facilitates faster learning iterations.</em></blockquote></p>
            <p>Feedback can be scary. Sometimes there is a sense of dread before reading it, like when you are waiting to hear back from a doctor or when your boss calls you into the office. You <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/07/brace-for-impact.html">brace for impact</a>. But that's not how it should be, not the feedback is constructive.</p>
            <p>What makes for good feedback? DBC asks us to give A.S.K. – "actionable, specific, and kind" – feedback.
              <ul>
                <li>Actionable – feedback that can be acted on by the recipient. Actionable feedback is <em>not</em> prescriptive; you're not telling them what to do. It is descriptive; you explain something that could be changed, but leave it to them to decide how.</li>
                <li>Specific – feedback that pinpoints an area that can be improved instead of generalizing. Some examples of specific feedback could be "There were times when you stopped talking, which left me feeling unsure how to proceed" or "You asking questions when I clammed up helped draw me out of my shell" instead of something less helpful like "You need to communicate better" or "Thanks for being friendly".</li>
                <li>Kind – feedback that is honest and genuine. Kind doesn't mean nice. Kind feedback is not about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210945/quotes?item=qt0461197">protecting feelings</a>, it is about helping each other grow. Being kind means telling your pair what they need to hear.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Giving actionable, specific, and kind feedback isn't always easy. Being nice is easy. Being vague is easy. Taking the time to think about what specific changes your pair could improve on, and expressing those in a kind and actionable way take effort and is an important responsibility. </p>
              <p>Sometimes you can't come up with anything to improve (in a reasonable time-frame). In that case you can point out things that your pair did well to reinforce those behaviors in their future pairings. Think of it as a kind of a "pay-it-forward" feedback.
              </p>
            <h3>Facing My Feedback</h3>
            <p>What about the feedback I received? Well... I felt pretty good reading it, mainly because it was mostly positive. It was great hearing from others about where I could use improvement, the most common of which were:
              <ul>
                <li>adapting to people with different learning styles than my own</li>
                <li>being more vocal / confident as the navigator, even if I am less experienced than my pair or not sure about the topic matter or if I feel like the driver knows what they are doing</li>
                <li>budgeting time to reflect on challenges with my pair after solving them</li>
                <li>practicing with methods in IRB to internalize how they work</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Based on what I received as feedback, I plan to make good friends with IRB (and <a href="http://www.compileonline.com/execute_ruby_online.php">other</a> Ruby testing <a href="http://repl.it/languages/Ruby">tools</a> as well. I believe working with these testing tools will help me coordinate better with partners who prefer a more hands-on approach versus my pseudocode and comment-heavy approach. I'll also focus on saying what I'm thinking, even if I have no idea if it will work. I'd rather be corrected than just sit there in silence.</p>

            <p>Overall, I think that pair programming and giving/receiving feedback has been beneficial and enjoyable as part of my Phase 0 learning experience, and I can't wait for more!</p>
