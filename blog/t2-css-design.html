              <h2>Boundaries Matter: <br>CSS Margins, Borders, and Padding</h2>
              <h4>Oct. 19th, 2014</h4>
              <h3>Knowing Where to Stop</h3>
              <p>Boundaries are important. You have to know where something starts and ends, what can overlap and what shouldn't. This applies to everything – work/life balance, relationships, personal space ... and CSS.</p>
              <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a type of code that, when written correctly, makes websites look beautiful instead of just being dull black text on a white background. Of the many things that CSS can modify, margins, borders, and padding are some of the most important.</p>

              <h3>Why do margins, borders and padding matter?</h3>

              <p>Just about anything on a web page – an icon, an image, a paragraph of text, etc. – is content. They may be different types of elements, but they all have set margins, borders, and padding (even if the values are set to 0).</p>
              <p>If content didn't have margins, borders, and padding, the only thing keeping different page elements from overlapping each other would be positioning, and even that alone wouldn't do a complete job. Hence the need for margins, borders, and padding.</p>

              <h3>What are margins, borders, and padding?</h3>

              <p>Margins are the outermost part of what is called the "CSS box model." Margin is essentially the empty space between two piece of content.</p>
              <p>For example, if you are standing across the room from someone, you would say there is a large margin between you. But if you were hugging someone, there would be no margin between you (or possible negative margin, if you are overlapping).</p>
              <p>In web design margin might be the space between a header and the main content area, or how far apart two images are from each other. Margin can sometimes be hard to determine if a page uses the same color for many elements.</p>
              <p>Borders are the middle part of the CSS box model. Borders are  basically outlines for content elements. Borders visually indicate where a content element begins and ends, like yellow "Do Not Cross" police tape.</p>
              <p>In web design, borders are often subtle, as thick or brightly colored borders tend to distract users from the page content.</p>
              <p>Padding is the inside of the CSS box model. Padding is the amount of space between the actual content element and the border. This functions just like padding in football – effectively increasing the size of the content element. Also like in football, padding provides an area of protective space between two elements that might have no margin between them, such as a player tackling another player.</p>
              <p>In web design, padding is necessary to keep content from being in contact with its borders. Increasing an element's padding will move the respective borders farther away from the content (which subsequently moves the margins farther out as well).</p>

              <p>Hopefully you now have a better understanding of margins, borders, and padding after reading this. That was the easy part, now you have to figure out how to use them! :P</p>
