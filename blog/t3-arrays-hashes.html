              <h2>Choosing Your Data Plan: Hashes and Arrays</h2>
              <h4>Oct. 25th, 2014</h4>
              <h3>What are hashes and arrays?</h3>
              <p>Hashes are pairs of items sorted by keys and values.
              <p>Wait, what?</p>
              <p>It's not as complicated as it sounds.</p>
              <p>Imagine you are filling out a form. Name, address, city, and so forth are examples of keys. Correspondingly, the values would be the actual information that is being paired with the keys, for example: "Sherlock Holmes", "221B Baker St.", "London". This is similar to how symbols on a map indicate something else, such as a star for a capital city or a dot for a normal city.</p>
              <p>What if you have data you want to store in a list instead of pairing things together?</p>
              <p>Arrays are lists of objects that are indexed starting at zero.</p>
              <p>Again, it's not as complicated as it sounds.</p>
              <p>Arrays keep whatever is entered into them in the order it was received and assign an index number to each entry. For example, if you were to create an array with the entries "thing", "other thing", "different thing", those entries would be indexed at 0, 1, and 2 respectively. The way I remember this "start counting from zero" concept is to think of a zombie outbreak. Why? Because the first person infected is usually referred to as "Patient Zero".</p>

              <h3>How do I know which to use?</h3>
              <h4>Hashes: Lists without Order</h4>
              <p>Hashes can be used for inventories, since different keys can have the same value. For example, in this hash,</p>
              <p><pre><code class="ruby">store_inventory { <br>
              :eggs => 12,<br>
              :bread => 3,<br>
              :hamburgers => 4,<br>
              :pizza => 3,<br>
              }
              </code></pre></p>
              <p>there are equal amounts of pizza and bread.</p>
              <p>Hashes are also useful for items that are logically paired together and lend themselves to the :key => "value" structure of a hash, but without the necessity of appearing in a linear numerical order. That could be the fields and answers of a form, or in the example below, players by position in a fantasy football roster.</p>
              <p><pre><code class="ruby">my_roster {
              :qb1 => "Drew Brees",<br>
              :wr1 => "Demaryius Thomas",<br>
              :wr2 => "Roddy White",<br>
              :wr3 => "Reuben Randle",<br>
              :rb1 => "Shane Vereen",<br>
              :rb2 => "Joique Bell",<br>
              :te1 => "Rob Gronkowski",<br>
              :flex => "Eddie Royal",<br>
              :k => "Adam Vinatieri",<br>
              :def => "San Francisco 49ers",<br>
              }
              </code></pre>
              </p>
              <h4>Arrays: Step-by-Step Lists</h4>
              <p>Array are best used for lists, especially lists that need to be kept in order. This is because arrays associate their entries with an index number (starting with zero). For example, if you were listing finishers in a race, you might make an array like this:</p>
              <p><pre><code class="ruby">runner_places = ["Frank", "Sam", "Tom"]
              </code></pre></p>
              <p>However, that would result in this when you printed it out:</p>
              <p>
              <pre><code class="ruby">
              "Frank" => 0<br>
              "Sam" => 1<br>
              "Tom" => 2<br>
              </code></pre>
              </p>
              <p>Not exactly what we wanted, right? We can make this work if we feed an extra value to the array when we create it. Something like this:</p>
              <p><pre><code class="ruby">
              "Name/Place" => 0<br>
              "Frank" => 1<br>
              "Sam" => 2<br>
              "Tom" => 3<br>
              </code></pre></p>
              <p>Both hashes and arrays have their uses. You'll have to decide what is best to use for whatever your information storing needs.</p>

              <h3>What can I do with hashes and arrays after I make them?</h3>
              <p>Hashes and arrays aren't just storage containers for information. They can be updated, sorted, transformed, and manipulated by all sorts of methods (methods are the "verbs" as opposed to objects aka "nouns" in the Ruby programming language). However, since that isn't the focus of this post, I won't delve into that rabbit hole. Suffice to say, hashes and arrays are not limited to just holding onto data.</p>
