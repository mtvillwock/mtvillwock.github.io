          <em>Full disclosure: Most of the ideas in this post come from <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#intro">this essay</a>. I'll do my best, however, to provide
            my own examples.</em>

          <h3>Making It Easy</h3>

            <p>One insidious problem with asking questions is that the questions
              often aren't concerned with understanding how or why something works; the person asking often just wants the answer. This isn't really a question. It's more of a demand. And while this sort of brusque attempt to collect information from other people might work in an authoritarian environment, it's not a great way to get help in the open source software community (or most places in life). Here's an example of a poor question:</p>
              <p><b>"How do I center a <div>?"</b></p>
              <p>Not particularly informative question, right? It doesn't say what attributes the <div> has or what other elements in the (presumably) HTML document might be interacting with it.</p>
            <p>So how can one ask a question that people will want to answer?</p>
            <p>Make it easy for them.</p>
            <p>This means knowing what you are trying to accomplish (the purpose) as well as explaining what you have attempted and the results you got from your experimentation. And while that may sound pretty simple, there is a lot that goes into refining all of that information into a good question.
            </p>

          <h3>What's the purpose?</h3>

            <p>Much like defining the scope of variables in code, it's important for your question to include the scope of your project. You don't want to drop a snippet of code in without any context and ask what is wrong with it. Likewise, you don't want to post an entire file containing hundreds of lines of code and say "Please help me fix it" without giving any context as to where to start.</p>
            <p>Know what you want to accomplish with your question. This means giving the overall goal of whatever you want to accomplish as well as the specific next step you are trying to reach.</p>
            <p>Going back to the example question, a revised version might look like this:</p>
            <p><b>"I'm making a basic HTML web page with five <div> containers that I am using as a header, a footer, two sidebars, and a main content area. How can I center the content div so that it is positioned evenly between the other 4 divs (one on each side)?"</b></p>
            <p>This question is better because it gives a scope of the project (basic web page) and the context of the problem (centering a div between 4 other divs). However, this question could still be improved.</p>

          <h3>What have you already tried?</h3>

            <p>Think of your question as the continuation of a science experiment. You wouldn't just call somebody over and ask them to help you combine some chemicals. Even if they were a scientist, they still wouldn't necessarily know what amounts of chemicals you were using or why you are trying to combine them. But even if they did know that, you can make their life even easier by also telling them what you have already tried and what the result of that test.</p>
            <p>By including details of what you have already tried in your question, you save time for whoever might try and assist you by answering questions they may have and allowing them to skip past answers they might otherwise provide (anyone who's been asked "Have you tried turning it off and then on again?" knows what I'm talking about).</p>
            <p><b>"I'm making a basic HTML web page with five <div> containers that I am using as a header, a footer, two sidebars, and a main content area. I looked <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/09/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/">here and</a> have tried using <pre><code>margin: 0</code></pre> and editing the positioning of the <pre><code>div</code></pre>s but haven't had any success. How can I center the content div so that it is positioned evenly between the other 4 divs (one on each side)?"</b></p>
            <p>This question is better because shows that you looked for resources to answer your question before you asked other people, and that you tried applying the information that you found to fix your problem. However, this question could still be improved if you were to provide the actual code that you are using. Often times there will be some typo or syntactical error that may be invisible to you but someone with a fresh set of eyes will spot right away. Also, if you give the larger code context (not necessarily an entire application, but maybe an entire file) and then point out a specific few lines, you give the reader the opportunity to see how the problem you are having interacts with the rest of your code. This opens the possibility of them suggesting a way to revise your code in full, and not just fixing a small bug like a syntax error.</p>

            <h3>Any Questions?</h3>
            <p>Asking questions is an essential skill, not just for software development, but for life. Above all, do some research before asking. Document the different attempts that you make and resources that you find while researching the problem. Doing this provides a background for other people to understand what you are trying to do, why it isn't working, and how to fix it.</p>
            <p>In short, help yourself by making it easy for other people to help you.</p>
