              <h2>Advice for the Squirrels</h2>
              <h4>Published 1/11/15</h4>
              <p>Greetings Squirrels! You're probably excited and nervous. Good, you'll need that energy. Here are some tips to help you out during your first week here.</p>

              <h3>Lean In</h3>
              <p>Don't recoil from the unknown. You're going to have moments of fear, doubt, confusion. Your brain will recoil, your stomach will heave, you'll want to do anything to distract yourself. Don't. Stick with it. Take a moment to meditate if you must, but come back to the screen and read the text. It's just text. You can understand it.</p>
              <p>Everyone is here to help you. However, despite some of the technical wizardry, none of us can read minds (except Sherif, sort of). What does this mean for you?</p>
              <p>Ask questions. Especially ask the teachers. The earlier you get used to doing this, the better it will be for you. Your question muscle will atrophy if you don't use it. Teachers, coaches, other students; ask them. They are here to help. Don't even wait, just go run and grab them.</p>
              <p>Don't ask what the "right way" to do something is, or what the "best practices" are. Just don't. You're in a playground of awesome, stop trying to figure out what is "right" and just have fun with it. You're too new to this to have any real idea of whether a practice is best or just common. If you have a choice between two ways of doing a challenge, do both of them.</p>
              <p>Write code that you can read. You can refactor it later. Readability is more important than trimming off a few lines.</p>
              <p>Take Engineering Empathy seriously. If you wanted to just learn code, you could be at any other coding bootcamp. But you're here to become a better person. So go into EE with your mind and heart open and make connections with your cohort by being vulnerable.</p>
              <p>Go to yoga. It's so nice to get a break from staring at a screen and to stretch. Plus the instructor is fun.</p>
              <p>Share your knowledge aggressively with your cohort. If you have a breakthrough, shout it out (if it's simple). Otherwise, write a blog post about it or give a quick lightning talk on it. Mention it as an Ah-ha! moment in the mornings. Get the word out.</p>
              <p>Coordinate with your cohort. You're a family. Get to know each other. Have lunch. Hang out on the weekend and blow off steam. You're going to be with these people for nine weeks, and they can all be awesome friends to you.</p>
              <p>Go see the counselors. You're going through a lot of changes – new location, new people, new material, and more. Take a half hour and express your feelings to them. You'll feel better.</p>
              <p>Book sessions with coaches.devbootcamp.com. Even if you don't have something directly troubling you, just do it. They will either strengthen your understanding or blow your mind.</p>
              <p>Figure out your learning style. Like books? Check the DBC Dropbox or the bookshelf in the Meadow. Like videos? Check out talks.devbootcamp.com, Ruby Tapas, Treehouse, and more.</p>

              <h3>Random Hacks</h3>
              <p>PSEUDOCODE. One of my most beloved parts of Phase 0 has even more importance here. You will save a lot of time on the harder challenges like Sudoku, Boggle, and so on if you can put down your plan in English. Use the whiteboards and talk it out with your pair.</p>
              <p>Learn keyboard shortcuts. Things like CMD+Tab to switch programs, CMD+CTRL + up/down to move lines of code in Sublime, CMD+` to switch between windows of the same program, CMD+Shift + left or right arrow to highlight lines of code, and more will all help you navigate without relying on a mouse, which will save you time.</p>
              <p>Shout out to Rilke for this one: use the scientific method. What that means for code is that you make a hypothesis, then test it. Then you repeat. This could be as simple as writing a method and then adding a `p` to it to print out the result so you can verify what it is actually doing. The point is that you can get terribly lost by writing a bunch of code that you <em>think</em> that you know what it is doing only to find you that your iterator method is returning nil for some reason. Don't change more than one variable (meaning function of your program) at a given time. This is especially relevant when doing iterations or recursion.</p>
              <p>Find a way to make the challenges relevant to your life. This will help you feel invested in the material, which helps you learn. How would you use iteration for an app you've been thinking about? Is there anything you could use recursion for in day to day life? What kind of object oriented programming design principles do you see in daily life?</p>

              <h3>Actionable Advice</h3>
              <p>Read POODR. If you haven't already, do so now. If you have already, do so again. It will help a lot with week 1 and 2. Seriously, I can't stress this enough.</p>
              <p>Give up on trying to know everything. Just know where to find it. Read to forget, focus on knowing where the information that you need is located instead of the information itself.</p>
              <p>Timebox. It's easy to get rabbit-holed on a challenge and end up having spent 3 hours trying to fix a bug or going about it completely the wrong way. Set an alarm. Check in on what you've accomplished every 30 minutes.</p>
              <p>Don't sweat the challenges. The focus is on learning, not passing a test. Give them your best shot and keep pushing, but don't do it just to cross it off your list. If you finish a challenge but can't explain the code or what you learned, then what is the point?</p>

              <h3>Parting Thoughts</h3>
              <p>You're going to have some moments where you just want to shout "my brain can't all the things and stuff" and you're going to have times that you think you're doing great. You're wrong both times. Stay humble, stay hungry.</p>
              <p>You're going to have days where you feel like you're keeping it together emotionally and the next morning when you wake up your superego will greet you with "Good morning motherfucker!" That's normal. You'll learn to silence your inner critic, but you'll have to work at it.</p>
              <p>You're not learning Ruby. You're learning how to learn. Whatever you learn here will be ancient history in six months. You'll probably learn several languages in the next year. That's technology. It's the concepts that matter.</p>
              <p>Follow the two-foot rule. If a lecture is not helping you learn, leave. This experience is your own, so don't let any of it be an accident or by default.</p>

              <p>The last thing I'll leave you with is a quote from Sherif Abushadi (who, if you haven't paired with him yet, you definitely should do so immediately):</p>
              <blockquote>"What you believe is learning – where someone tells you a fact or procedure – is not learning. Learning is a complex, confusing process of exploring things you don't understand. ... Stop asking a 'simple question' and then pretending you're okay after we work through it. I know you have like seventeen other questions."</blockquote>
              <p>Good luck, Squirrels. You can do this!</p>
