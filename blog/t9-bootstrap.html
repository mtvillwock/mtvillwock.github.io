              <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
              <h4>Published December 7th, 2014</h4>
              <h3>The Framework</h3>
              <p>Heading into today, I didn't much care for how my GitHub pages site looked. I had tinkered with it several times over the past week, but most of the changes weren't exciting and failed to make me feel good about the site. These week, I decided to try Bootstrap.</p>
              <p>Bootstrap is a CSS framework created that allows faster, convenient creation of CSS stylesheets, which is incredibly useful for today's modern age of lightning fast startups. It has pre-made CSS ids and classes that are useful for common styling tasks, like making buttons or creating headers and footers.</p>
              <p>For anyone interested in using Bootstrap, you can go <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">here</a> to download it. After you do that, walk through this course on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website/">making a website</a> by Codecademy. They start using Bootstrap towards the last third of the course and it's a great introduction to the concepts.</p>
              <h3>How Far We've Come</h3>
              <p>It's been quite a journey. Less than nine weeks ago I had a web page that looked like something that a 12-year-old from the mid-90s had created. Now... well, I'll be honest. The giant header image with some nicely separated blocks of content underneath isn't exactly a new concept since Bootstrap emerged. But I suppose that's not Bootstrap's purpose. Bootstrap isn't intended to transform people into amazing designers, it's made to help developers get sites created.</p>
              <p>Thank you, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people">Bootstrap contributors</a>. For someone like myself who is not the most visually inclined person, this CSS magic that you've conjured is amazing. </p>
              <p>One of the most time consuming parts of maintaining this website over the past nine weeks was that every time I went to edit the CSS file, I'd spend at least an hour tweaking margins, padding, and colors in an effort to make it look nice. But with Bootstrap in my arsenal, I feel much more confidant in being able to create something that looks more like what I wireframed.</p>
              <p>If nothing else, working on my own site has given me something to be a little proud of. Yes, it's relatively simple, and all I did was add two blog entries a week and tweak the CSS here and there. But it has been a growing experience. I've learned a lot about how plans shift over time and the importance of thinking things out before coding.</p>
              <p>Thanks for joining me over the last nine weeks. I hope to see you around for the next nine!</p>
