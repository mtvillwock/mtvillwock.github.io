          <h3>Identifying the Threat</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">Stereotype threat</a>  refers to "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steele">Claude M. Steele</a>
  gave a talk several years ago at Columbia University in which he discusses the phenomenon. That talk can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk"></a>here . I'll do my best to summarize Claude's findings as best as I understand them. </p>
            <p>Stereotype threats are basically how your performance is affected by the societal perception of one of your identities (age, race, gender, sexuality, socio-economic status, formal education status, etc.).</p>
            <p>For example, in some tests, black students average scores a full standard deviation below white students. Yet when told beforehand that the tests were puzzles that had nothing to do with measuring intelligence, that achievement gap narrowed or vanished. Similar findings occurred with women taking advanced math or engineering courses. The effects of these identity contingencies are not limited to society perceiving the identity that you associate yourself with as being lesser, but also when you are competing against a person whose identity society perceives as being better as the task. For example, white students in math or engineering courses faced a similar achievement gap when exposed to the stereotype that Asians naturally outperformed whites academically.</p>
            <p>What is causing this under-performing? Steele offers up the term "identity contingencies" to describe the sort of self-handicapping that can occur in stressful situations. You’re grappling with a challenge, perhaps a standardized test. You hit a problem that you can't solve. You skip it. It nags at you as you're working on the next problem. Why couldn't you solve it? It is because you didn't study? Because you're a certain race or gender? This doubt eats at you. You struggle to focus. You feel defensive, your palms sweaty. All you want is for the test to be over. Pretty substantial for a psychological effect, right?</p>
            <p>When experiencing these perceived stereotype threats, the mind becomes vigilante and rigid. The amygdala (associated with fear and memory) becomes very active, and the prefrontal cortex (associated with logical reasoning) shuts down. A psychological experience affects you physiologically, with powerful results that contribute to under-performing.</p>

          <h3>Facing the Threats</h3>
            <p>I did well in math before high school. Once I got there, however, it was like I hit a brick wall. I found little support or enjoyment of the subject and, in hindsight, developed a bit of a <a href="http://examinedexistence.com/carol-dweck-on-fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/">fixed mindset</a> about the topic. This continued in college. I had a lot of engineer friends who mocked me whenever we discussed anything math-related. As a result, I avoided such classes as best I could. I struggled with the LSAT and the quantitative reasoning section of the GRE.  I would tense up when people asked what I was majoring in. I would physiologically generate tension between my shoulder blades before math tests. </p>
            <p>It wasn't until my senior year that I took an elementary logic course that was presented differently than most math courses I had taken and began to see that I could actually understand this stuff. In a way, that course laid the ground for me to attend Dev Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>When I look back, I wonder what might have been different if I had not faced a stereotype threat of being a humanities student. Would I have stayed in those majors? Might I have begun shedding my fixed mindset sooner?</p>
            <p>I realize that these are pretty minor issues compared to the identity contingencies that other identities may face. But I empathize with those who face these challenges. I don't like labels. I don’t like ascribing statuses to others. The idea that you can or can't do something based on an identity that you may or may not have chosen is garbage.</p>
            <p>We are fragile creatures, we humans. And we are social by nature. But we are also adaptive. We need to address these stereotype threats, because they are a real and powerful problem. But they are a problem that can be fought, reduced, negated. How?</p>

          <h3>So what can we do about this?</h3>
            <p>Claude gives some suggestions about how to combat the insidious effects of identity contingencies. He recounted a study wherein Black students were given feedback on an essay they volunteered to write (no grade involved) in one of three ways from a white professor. The third method of giving feedback, where the professor told the students that their essays could be really great if they kept working at them, was the only method that saw a significant number of students revise their essays.</p>
            <p>What's the takeaway here?</p>
            <p>The third method, Steele explains, has the professor expressing belief in the students. This breaks through the vigilance that identity contingencies tend to create, and indicated to the students that the professor's feedback was based on what they thought of the essay and not about the students' race.</p>
            <p>Another example included letters from previous Black students at Columbia to incoming Black freshman. The general message of these letters was that adjusting to life in a campus of Gothic buildings where you were clearly the minority was overwhelming at first, but that embracing it and getting comfortable in the new environment was not only possible, but rewarding. According to the study, students who read these letters saw a marked increase in academic improvement against the average for up to two years.</p>
            <p>The takeaway? Positive cues in or preceding situations that are rife with potential stereotype threats or identity contingencies help buffer the impact of those threats. Experiencing a positive cue like this lays the groundwork for the mind to identify that not all possible threats are actually threats. Over time your brain better differentiates what is and is not truly a threat and this allows you perform with less or no distracting anxiety.</p>

            <h3>Implementing Countermeasures</h3>
            <p>When facing the stereotype threat (or if I suspect someone else is), I think that taking a walk is a helpful first step. The physiological reactions to the stereotype threat are similar to those of the general fight-or-flight reaction that humans have in stressful situations. Disengaging from the threat will allow the amygdala to calm down and the prefrontal cortex to reassert itself.</p>
            <p>After getting some distance, I think that giving/getting feedback would help. I would request or provide feedback based on what the person is doing and how it can work. Helpful feedback can provide a positive cue to the person experiencing the stereotype threat, reassuring them that they are capable of the challenge they are facing. Giving someone a helping hand when they are down can set the stage for future growth/collaboration.</p>
            <p>I think I already used this in a previous blog post, but I'll reiterate it here:</p>
            <blockquote><em>“The only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them.”</em> – <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130590-the-only-man-i-know-who-behaves-sensibly-is-my"></a>George Bernard Shaw</blockquote>
            <p>The fact is, we don’t know anything about anybody. Not really, not even our friends. We know about their past, perhaps, but we don’t know how their day has gone or about experiences they've had that they haven't shared with us. So I think a really important part of circumventing stereotype threats is to (and this is the hard part) come into situations with no preconceived notions. Ask questions of others and listen so that you understand what they are going through and/or struggling to understand. And on the opposite side, (again, the hard part) be honest about how you feel and what you don’t know.</p>
            <p>I know this post got away from me a bit, but I hope it explained the concept of stereotype threat in an understandable manner. Thanks for reading!</p>
