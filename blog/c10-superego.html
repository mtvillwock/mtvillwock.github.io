              <p>Superego is that voice in your head that beats you down after you make a mistake. It's the voice that lets you know unrelentingly that you are a bad person, or shameful, or not good enough.</p>
              <p>It's also total bullshit.</p>
              <p>The superego is an evolutionary shame-like aspect of our psyche that acts as a kind of omnipresent parent figure that is always ready to scold us for any minor mistake that we make, real or imagined.</p>
              <p>Here's an example:</p>
              <p>I was pairing with someone on a challenge. There were parts of our session (which lasted about 3 or 4 hours) where I felt frustrated early on. Later on, when I was feeling better about the challenge, I noticed some behaviors that led me to believe that my pair was frustrated. My pair asked me if we could move on to the next challenge. I said that was fine and suggested we take a short break before proceeding. After we reconvened, my pair told me that they wanted to work on the next challenge separately.</p>
              <p>Cue the superego.</p>
              <p>My mind immediately wondered what I had done wrong to cause this behavior. Note the flaw in this thought process â€“ it assumes guilt without evidence. Not only is that un-American, it's illogical and emotionally unhealthy.</p>
              <p>I wrestled with my concerns about the possibility of having upset my pair for about an hour. Eventually I walked over to my pair and asked if I could check in, explaining that I was concerned that I had done something to offend them and wanted to know if there was anything I could do to improve the situation.</p>
              <p>To my (superego's) surprise, my pair told me that I hadn't done anything wrong and that they were just on edge from not getting enough sleep. Imagine that!</p>
              <p>That's only one simple example of how the superego can trip you up.</p>
