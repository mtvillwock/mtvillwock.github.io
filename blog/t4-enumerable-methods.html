          <h3>Enumer-What?</h3>
            <p>Enumerable. Enum. Enumerator. These words come up a lot in the Ruby documentation. But what the heck do they mean, and why should you care?</p>
            <p>Here's my pitch.</p>
            <h3>Keep It <s>Simple</s> Concise</h3>
            <p><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html" target="blank">Enumerable</a> is a Module in Ruby that is used in many different Classes, including arrays, hashes, and ranges.
            <blockquote>"The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection." ~ Ruby Documentation, Enumerable</blockquote>
              Essentially it grants a Class (whether it is one you made, or a pre-built one), the ability to use <i>variations</i> of the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html#method-i-each">#each</a> method, such as <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-find" target="blank">#find</a>, <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-group_by" target="blank">#group_by</a>, and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-map" target="blank">#map</a>.</p>
            <p>What's the catch?</p>
            <p>The Class that includes the Enumerable module must "define an <i>each<i> instance method". (The Well-Grounded Rubyist, pg. 287). </p>
            <p>What would that look like?
              <pre><code>
                class NewClass
                  include Enumerable
                  def each
                    # "Behavior that yields items to a supplied code block one at a time" (pg. 287)
                  end
                end
              </code></pre>
              Not a bad price to pay in order to access a bunch of useful data manipulation methods, right?
            </p>
          <h3>Mapping It Out</h3>
            <p>Okay, so what's an example of one of these much-hyped Enumerable methods?</p>
            <p>How about <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-map" target="blank">#map</a>?</p>
            <p>The #map method has a few cool features. First, whatever information you feed to it will be returned as a new array. So if you had a range of numbers 1 through 10 and you wanted to square each of them, you'd do this: </p>
              <pre><code>
                range_mapped_to_array = (1..10).map { |x| x * x }
              </code></pre>
            <p>And get this back:
            </p>
            <p><pre><code>
              #=> [1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
            </code></pre></p>
            <p>But what if you wanted to permanently make a change to your data?</p>
            <p>That's where #map! comes in. What's the difference?</p>
            <p>Pretty simple: #map is non-destructive and #map! is destructive. #map creates a copy of your data as an array, and then applies whatever transformations you feed to the code block (in the example above, <pre><code>|x|</code></pre> represents each element in the array, and <pre><code>x * x</code></pre> are the instructions for how to modify the array). #map! makes transformations to an existing array, permanently modifying it.
            <p>Here's an example:</p>
            <p>
            <pre><code>
              squared_array_destructively_mapped_to_floats = range_mapped_to_array.map! { |x| x.to_f }
              puts squared_array_destructively_mapped_to_floats
              #=>[1.0, 4.0, 9.0, 16.0, 25.0, 36.0, 49.0, 64.0, 81.0, 100.0]
            </code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>Tada! Now you have an array of squared numbers that are floated (they have a decimal instead of being an integer). And they'll stay that way. I didn't have to assign a new variable name to the floated version of the array, because the original array that I created from mapping the range was destructively modified, but I did to illustrate what was happening.</p>

            <p>However, thanks to my superfluous but descriptive variable, I now have two arrays with different names and the same transformed contents. Oops! Just something to remember. Be careful with 'destructive' methods, they have that descriptive adjective for a reason!</p>
            <p>Note: Technically, #map! is an Array method, but using #map returns an array, so you can use #map to store something in an array and then permanently alter that array by using the #map! method.</p>
            <p>I hope this explanation of the Enumerable module and the Enumberable#map method made sense.</p>
