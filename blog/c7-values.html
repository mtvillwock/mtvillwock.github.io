              <h2>Affirming Values against Stereotype Threat</h2>
              <h4>Published Nov. 23rd, 2014</h4>
              <h3>Evaluating my values</h3>
              <p>During this week of Phase 0, I was asked to reflect on some values that come to mind when I think of "happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied" moments and then talk about why one of the values mattered to me. I came up with this list:</p>
              <p>
              <ul>
              <li>Challenge</li>
              <li>Community</li>
              <li>Growth</li>
              <li>Friendships</li>
              <li>Loyalty</li>
              <li>Movement</li>
              <li>Self-Knowledge</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>I place an importance on Community because I believe that who you associate with impacts you nearly as much as anything that you do individually. There are studies and <a href="http://blog.pickcrew.com/why-you-eat-buy-and-weigh-the-same-as-your-friends/">articles</a>  about this phenomenon.</p>
              <p>I generally try to live up to these values, but as you can see from my rankings, I'm not totally where I'd like to be with all of them.</p>
              <p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Challenge 4</li>
              <li>Community 3</li>
              <li>Growth 4</li>
              <li>Friendships 4</li>
              <li>Loyalty 5</li>
              <li>Movement 2</li>
              <li>Self-Knowledge 2</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The reason for the neutral score in Community is because I am not as aggressive about seeking out new people to associate with or befriend and I also am not great at disassociating myself from people who do not benefit me. Loyalty is a factor in that.</p>
              <p>The low score in movement because I haven't traveled much (geographically and, dare I say it,  academically/intellectually) and thus I have a limited perception of the world. I am working to fix this. The low score in self-knowledge is because I don't feel like I've had enough experiences to know "who I am" yet.</p>
              <p>The last topic I gave advice on was actually blog writing for a friend, which you can read <a href="http://www.akhileshdakinedi.com/blog/">here</a>.</p>
              <h3>Weighing my values against the stereotype threat</h3>
              <p>I feel like there is room for improvement in my values. I think my values are good and important but not optimal yet. I think that I can mediate stereotype threat when I feel it (I believe I was doing that earlier this week, actually) by affirming my values of growth and challenge, as well as relying on my community to affirm that my abilities <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself">"are assumed, not questioned"</a>  at DBC.</p>
              <p>I think there are many things that could help me when I feel down at DBC. Taking a walk, looking at old challenges that I vanquished, talking with a classmate, speaking with the counselor, taking deep breaths, getting some food, and more could all help me feel better.</p>
              <p>That's all I got this week. Hopefully this told you a bit about my values. If you're interested in more about affirmation and stereotype threat, read this <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself"></a>article. Thanks for reading!</p>
