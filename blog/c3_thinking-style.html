            <h3>What is my thinking style?</h3>

           <p>The weekend before starting Phase 0 at DBC, I took a test to determine my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc thinking style</a>. Three weeks later, as preparation for this post, I took the test again. The results of the two tests varied in each of the four categories, except for Abstract Random, which is what I decided to focus on. So what is an Abstract Random thinking style?</p>

           <p>Let's break that down into <em>abstract</em> and <em>random</em>.

            <p>Abstract thinking refers to traits like "visualization, believing, and understanding things you cannot actually see." Abstract thinking uses "intuition, imagination, and ... looking beyond 'what is' to the more subtle implications" in problem solving and everyday life.</p>
           <p>Random thinking means exactly what it sounds like: random. Sometimes there doesn't seem to be a logical or linear manner of how a random thinker's thoughts get from point A to point B. This is because random thinkers organize "chunks" of information in their minds with no predetermined order. This can lead to logical leaps based on intuition or deviating from linear, straightforward processes.</p>

           <p>None of this is good or bad. Each thinking style has its benefits, and everyone has some portion of each thinking style in them; they just might not use each of them equally. So what does knowing that I'm (primarily) an abstract random thinker mean for my experience in Phase 0?</p>

           <h3>Phase 0 as an Abstract Random thinker (or my experience, at least)</h3>


<blockquote> Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.</blockquote>

            <p>The quote above explains a lot about my experience during Phase 0 thus far. So far in Phase 0, I've found that I have performed best in pair programming situations. Pair programming allows me to work with other people, and after the session is over I have time to reflect on what I learned.</p>
           <p>My biggest struggle in Phase 0 has been time management. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I really like solving things for myself, but this can be detrimental when operating on a deadline. I've also found that I don't feel like I'm producing work that is up to the standards of my peers, despite our different backgrounds and varying skill sets. I get anxious about this, especially when writing reflections for assignments, leaving feedback for pairing sessions, or writing these blog posts. </p>
           <p>Both the successes and challenges of my first three weeks of Phase 0 seem to correlate with my thinking style. I feel like pair programming really plays to my strengths because it allows me to work with another person, and although we have a shared goal, we can take any number of paths to accomplish our task. Additionally, our challenges come with required feedback and reflection writing, which helps me internalize what I learned during the session. However, sometimes my thinking style doesn't do me any favors, especially when work on my own. Sometimes I'll end up going down a rabbit hole when researching a topic, or I'll feel overwhelmed by a large, structured task list. This can lead to problems with time management.</p>
           <p>To address the areas where I've been struggled, I've begun implementing a time limit of 10 minutes for any roadblocks I run into while coding. After that, if I can't figure something out on my own, I turn to the DBC Google+ community or Google for assistance. I've also done my best to stop comparing myself to others in my cohort when reflecting. My new focus is to learn from what others have done instead of beating myself up for not being as good as everyone else.</p>

           <h3>Brain Stretching: Keeping the Growth Mindset</h3>

           <p>The mind, like any other muscle, grows when stretched. We can literally change the physical shape and functioning of our brain by challenging ourselves to think in new ways.</p>
           <p>Based on my Abstract Random thinking style, I learn most effectively by interacting with other people, so I'm looking forward to my future pairing sessions. However, there are still another six weeks of Phase 0 left. That means I have plenty of time that I need to learn and grow on my own.</p>
           <p>In order to stretch my mind, I can focus on the opposite thinking style, Concrete Sequential. In general, Concrete Sequential is the type of thinking that performs best in <a href="http://www.parentinggiftedkids.com/2009/05/what-is-gifted-part-4-two-types-of.html">traditional school settings</a> because Concrete Sequential thinkers "like order, structure, rules and logic." So I think that using some of the same strategies that did well for me in college will help me during the remainder of Phase 0. Additionally, I think Phase 0 is a great tune-up for me to refresh myself with this style of thinking. I mean, look at some of the items on <a href="http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm">this list</a>:
            <ul>
              <li>Needs and enjoys structured situations.</li>
              <li>Likes to work with hands-on projects.</li>
              <li>Likes things to be ordered and arranged in specific ways.</li>
              <li>Likes clear and definite directions.</li>
              <li>Prefers to do things step by step.</li>
              <li>Follows directions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I think that the remainder of Phase 0 will help me strengthen those attributes. I will learn to operate effectively with and without others, and I will solidify my ability to stay focused on one task, a step at a time.</p>
            <p>If you made it through all that, thanks for sticking with me. Hopefully you learned a little about Abstract Random thinking (or about me). Take care!</p>
